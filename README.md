## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used to model the relationship between the independent variable `x` and the dependent variable `y` as an nth-degree polynomial. Unlike simple linear regression, which fits a straight line to the data, polynomial regression can capture more complex relationships by introducing polynomial terms.

In polynomial regression, the model equation takes the form:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + ... + \beta_nx^n + \varepsilon $$

where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable,
- $x$ is the independent variable,
- $\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients,
- $n$ is the degree of the polynomial,
- $\varepsilon$ represents the error term.

By including higher-degree polynomial terms, polynomial regression can better fit nonlinear patterns in the data. However, selecting an appropriate degree for the polynomial is crucial to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Polynomial regression is a powerful tool in predictive modeling when relationships between variables are not linear and require a more flexible approach to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
